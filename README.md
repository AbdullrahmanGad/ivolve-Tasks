Perfect — thanks for the updated folder structure.
Here’s a clean, professional **main `README.md`** that fits your setup, with clickable links to each lab’s subfolder README (so they open directly on GitHub 👇):

# 🚀 DevOps Labs Collection

This repository contains hands-on labs covering **Linux**, **Ansible**, and **Docker** — demonstrating configuration management, automation, and containerization best practices.
Each folder includes a dedicated `README.md` detailing the objectives, setup, and commands.

✅ **Tip:**
Click any lab name to view its README directly. Each section demonstrates a different automation or containerization concept step by step.

Would you like me to make it slightly more visual (e.g., icons per lab like 🐍 for Python, ☁️ for AWS, 🔒 for Vault)? It can make the GitHub page look more polished.
